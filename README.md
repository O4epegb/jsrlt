Towards the end of 2019 I took my dog for a walk and got to thinking about making a game. For whatever reason the technical and conceptual requirements happened to line up just right in my brain and I managed to convince myself that not only could I do this, it wouldn't even be that hard. You can read more about that experience here. Suffice it to say the most popular tutorial out there are is in python and uses libtcod. I'm a javascript engineer by day and really didn't feel like learning a new language. I also wanted to do as much of it from scratch as possible so I could learn to actually write a game, not how to use a library.

I've never written a proper tutorial so we'll see how this goes - learning together!
